  I was originally going to make videos recreating these other websites, but
  most people commented saying they want to learn something else (like JavaScript).

  I will be delaying these solutions for a while to work on courses for other
  technologies.

  For now, just try to make your code look close to Twitter, Instagram, etc.
  There's no "right" way to do these, they are for more practice if you're interested.

  Who knows, maybe I'll promote your code here as the example solution :)

  Thanks for checking out the course! You're the best!
  Now, on to the next course!
